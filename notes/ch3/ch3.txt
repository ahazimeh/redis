sql design methodology
    1- put the data in tables
    2- figure out how we will query it

redis design methodology
    1- figure out what queries we need to answer
    2- structure data to best answer those queries

design consideration:
    what type of data are we storing
    should we be concerned about the size of data
    do we need to expire this data
    what will the key naming policy be for this data
    any business-logic concerns

key naming methodology
    Keys should be unique
    Other engineers should understand what a key is for
    Tip - use functions to generate your key names so you never make a typo
    Extremely common practice is to use a ':' to separate different parts of the key

common practice
    users:posts:901
small twist to common practice
    users:posts#901

keys.ts
export const pageCacheKey = (id: string) => `pagecache#${id}`;
