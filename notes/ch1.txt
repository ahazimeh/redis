why redis: redis is fast
redis is fast for 3 reasons:
    1- all data is stored in memory (not hard drive and memory)
        disadvantages: can't work with dataset larger than memory of pc
    2- organize/store all data inside simple data structure
    3- fast because it is very simple, do not have a lot of features (to make it easy) but slower
