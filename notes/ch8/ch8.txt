for other languages like python you can use;

client = redis. Redis(...)
pipe = client.pipeline()
pipe.set('foo', 'bar')
pipe.get('bing')
pipe.execute()

// node-redis
const results = await Promise.all([
client.get('color'),
client.get('name')
]);

exec will execute them with MULTI at the start and EXEC at the end, while execAsPipeline will execute them "normally" and collect all the results into an array.

This definitely should be in the docs, I'll leave this issue open for now..

const [getReply, setReply] = await client.multi()
  .get('1')
  .set('2', '2')
  .execAsPipeline();
}
