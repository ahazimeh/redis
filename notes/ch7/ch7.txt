Reasons to Store as Hash
    The record has many attributes
    A collection of these records have to be sorted many different ways
    Often need to access a single record at a time

Don't Use Hashes When...
    The record is only for counting or enforcing uniqueness
    Record stores only one or two attributes
    Used only for creating relations between different records
    The record is only used for time series data

for node redis: for new Date() redis will automatically call toString() on it

const serialize = (user: CreateUserAttrs) => {
	return {
		username: user.username,
		password: user.password
	};
};

const deserialize = (id: string, user: { [key: string]: string }) => {
	return {
		id,
		username: user.username,
		password: user.password
	};
};
