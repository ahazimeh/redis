Streams
  Kind of like a cross between a list and a sorted set
  Used for communication between different servers
  Most useful with 'consumer groups'
  TONS AND TONS of tiny details

XADD fruites * color red name strawberry

XREAD count 1 STREAMS fruites 0-0 // read all messages in the stream

// wait for up to 3 seconds for new data to be added
XREAD BLOCK 3000 STREAMS fruites 1720975546055-0

XREAD COUNT 5 BLOCK 3000 STREAMS fruites $ // $ means now

XRANGE fruites 1720975574297-0 1720975574298-0
XRANGE fruites (1720975574297-0 1720975574298-0 // ( to not exclude, // and same for end range
XRANGE fruites 1720975574297-0 + // everything above 1720975574297-0
XRANGE fruites - 1720975574297-0 // everything below 1720975574297-0

2 problems:
  standard streams deliver all messages to all consumers
  handling consumer crashing
Consumer Group
  we will have some number of workers
  unique name for different workers
using consumer groups will insure that no 2 workers receiving the same message
Steam log: creating log to where each message is getting sent
  -I sent 123123-0 to 'emailer-1' and they acknowledged receipt
  -I sent 999-0 to 'emailer-2' they didn't acknowledged receipt.
  -Last Delivered ID for each worker
