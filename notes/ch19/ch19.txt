Redis Stack contains several modules by default
    RedisSearch, RedisJSON, RedisGraph, RedisTimeSeries, RedisBloom
depending on how you deploy/run your application you might not be able to use modules

option 1: managed copy of redis
aws or google cloud to handle everything // can't use modules
option 2: to run a virtual machine or container, run redis inside so we can use modules
downside, it requires setup by ourselves (backups, security updates...)
option: 3, rely on company redis

to use redi search
    create an index, find all keys that starts with items:#
    record some info about the fields: name, color, and price
create index: FT.CREATE
run a query: FT.SEARCH

HSET cars#a1 name 'fast car' color red year 1950
HSET cars#b1 name 'car' color red year 1960
HSET cars#c1 name 'old car' color blue year 1970
HSET cars#d1 name 'new car' color blue year 1990

FT.CREATE idx:cars on HASH PREFIX 1 cars#
    SCHEMA name TEXT year NUMERIC color TAG

FT.SEARCH idx:cars '@name:(fast car)'
FT.SEARCH idx:cars '@color:{blue}'
FT.SEARCH idx:cars '@year:[blue]'

Querying vs Searching
    Querying: gives the exact result you ask for:
    Searching: gives results that best answer your question:

FT.CREATE
    indexes ususally follow the naming convention idx:<thing>
    ON HASH / ON JSON
    PREFIX 1 cars# // 1 means we can have multiple different prefixes
    SCHEMA: describe the fields that should be indexed for each hash (don't have to list the schema of every field - only the onces we want to search)
