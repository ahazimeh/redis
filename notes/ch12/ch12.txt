sorted sets use cases:
    Tabulating 'the most' or 'the least' of a collection of hashes
        you can store set of hashes by saving the keys for a hash and giving it a score
    Creating relationships between records, sorted by some criteria
        same as sets but with sorting (such as to get common books sorted with most reviews)
parseInt(id, 16) // base 16 to 10
const id = decimalId.toString(16) // base 10 to 16
